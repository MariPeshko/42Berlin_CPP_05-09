Exercise 02: PmergeMe

You must create a program with these constraints:

• Your program must be able to use a positive integer sequence as an argument.
• Your program must use the merge-insert sort algorithm to sort the positive integer sequence.
• A container for the exercise - vector.

To clarify, yes, you need to use the Ford-Johnson algorithm.
(source: Art Of Computer Programming, Vol.3. Merge Insertion, Page 184.)

• If an error occurs during program execution, an error message should be displayed on the standard error.

Your program must be able to handle at least 3000 different integers.

Here are some additional guidelines on the information you should display line by line on the standard output:
• On the first line you must display an explicit text followed by the unsorted positive integer sequence.
• On the second line you must display an explicit text followed by the sorted positive integer sequence.

$> ./PmergeMe 3 5 9 7 4
Before: 3 5 9 7 4
After: 3 4 5 7 9

$> ./PmergeMe "-1" "2"
Error

The management of errors related to duplicates is left to your
discretion.
